# DeafMan1983.Interop.Cairo
Wrapper for Cairo

Initial release of Cairo without CairoSharp because CairoSharp is incompatible for NativeAot - Importan
Do not use CairoSharp because CairoSharp has sometimes Marshal class that is why it can't work for Net 7.x and newer...

Please remember that. I would like to create other for Gtk4 - Come soon...
